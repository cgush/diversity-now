      		<p>Fashion is a powerful communicator to people about their identity.</p><br/>
	<br/>
	<p>NOW! is the time for CREATIVES to boldly vision a fashion future which steps beyond stereotypes, redefines boundaries and celebrates a wider range of beauty and body ideals in age, size, shape and race.</p><br/>
	<br/>
	<p>A fashion future that empowers and emboldens people, which envisions impactful, emotionally considerate practices in all areas of the industry.</p><br/>
	<br/>
	<p>Take your lead from industry visionaries such as Vivienne Westwood, Nick Knight, Mark Fast, Alexander McQueen, Hussein Chalayan, Kayt Jones and Chen Man but remember we want you to show us what YOUR fashion future looks like.</p><br/>
	<br/>
	<p>Weâ€™re looking for directional, aspirational imagery showcasing fashion on a range of bodies/individuals. Think exciting, striking and cutting-edge images or prose.</p><br/>
