      		<h2>Fashion is a powerful communicator to people about their identity.</h2><br/>
	<br/>
	<p>NOW! is the time for next-gen creative stars to boldly vision a fashion future which steps beyond stereotypes, redefines boundaries and celebrates a wider range of beauty and body ideals in age, size, shape and race.</p><br/>
	<br/>
	<p>A fashion future that empowers and emboldens people, which envisions impactful, emotionally considerate practices in all areas of the industry.</p><br/>
	<br/>
	<p>Take your lead from industry visionaries such as <span class="upper">Vivienne Westwood, Nick Knight, Mark Fast, Alexander McQueen, Hussein Chalayan, Kayt Jones</span> and <span class="upper">Chen Man</span> but remember we want you to show us what <span class="reverse">YOUR fashion future</span> looks like.</p><br/>
	<br/>
	<p>Weâ€™re looking for directional, aspirational work showcasing fashion on a range of bodies/individuals. Think exciting, striking and cutting-edge images or prose.</p><br/>
